            Your faith was strong but you needed proof
            You saw her bathing on the roof
            Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
            She tied you to a kitchen chair
            She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
            And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

            You say I took the name in vain
            I don't even know the name
            But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
            There's a blaze of light in every word
            It doesn't matter which you heard
            The holy or the broken Hallelujah

            I did my best, it wasn't much
            I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
            I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
            And even though it all went wrong
            I'll stand before the Lord of Song
            With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
